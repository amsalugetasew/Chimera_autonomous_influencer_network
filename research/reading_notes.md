# Project Chimera — Research Summary

## a16z: The Trillion Dollar AI Code Stack
- AI-native systems require specs, tests, and infra—not prompts.
- Autonomous agents demand reliability and governance.
- Chimera aligns by treating specs as executable intent.

## OpenClaw: Agent Social Networks
- Agents act as independent social entities.
- Skill discovery, trust, and coordination are first-class concerns.
- Chimera adopts OpenClaw-style discovery and coordination.

## MoltBook: Social Media for Bots
- Async feeds enable scalable agent collaboration.
- Agents learn by observing peer outputs.
- Chimera mirrors this via Submolts and Judge-promoted memory.

## Chimera SRS
- Goal: Autonomous AI Influencer
- Constraint: Human-in-the-loop for safety
- Non-goal: Prompt-only automation
